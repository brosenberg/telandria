=T=How To Make a Pathfinder Character
=1=Pick a Class
The rulebooks say to start with picking your ability scores, but it is hard to do that if you don't know what scores are relevant. It is easiest to start with a class. Pick what class you want your character to be from the list below. Consult the PRD for more indepth descriptions of each class.

=1=Determine Ability Scores
Either role for stats or use Point Buy, depending on what your DM says. If you are using 15 point Point Buy, the following is a fairly good set of ability scores to use:
16, 14, 12, 10, 10, 8
Assign the highest score to your class's Primary Stat, then the next highest to the Secondary Stats. Assign the rest as you see fit.
The ability modifier for an ability score is the ((ability score)-10)/2. For example, a score of 16 would have a modifier of 3 and a score of 7 would have a modifier of -2.

=1=Pick a Race
Choose the race that you think makes the most sense for your character. Either for roleplaying reasons or because the race's stat bonuses match well with your class choice. Apply the bonuses and penalties listed below to your character's stats. The core races and their stat bonuses are listed below. See the PRD for the rest of their abilities.
=DL=Dwarf: +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma
=DL=Elf: +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Constitution
=DL=Gnome: +2 Charisma, +2 Constitution, -2 Strength
=DL=Half Elf: +2 to any one ability score
=DL=Half Orc: +2 to any one ability score
=DL=Halfling: +2 Charisma, +2 Dexterity, -2 Strength
=DL=Human: +2 to any one ability score

=1=Pick a Favored Class
Every time you level up, you get to pick which class you level up in. If the class you choose to level up in is your Favored Class you get either a skillpoint bonus, a hitpoint bonus, or a bonus unique to your race. This applies to first level as well. If you don't plan on ever leveling up in any class other than the class you are at first level, you want to pick that class as your Favored Class. Otherwise your favored class should be the class you plan to level up the most in.
The standard Favored Class bonus is either +1 skill point or +1 hit point. You probably want the hit point if you are a melee class or take a lot of damage. Otherwise you probably want the skill point.
Things to note:
=E=Half-Elves get two Favored class.

=1=Pick Skills
There are many skills to choose from, and each class gets a different number of skill points. At first level you can only put one skill point into a skill. If you put a point into a skill that is a Class Skill for your class, you get a +3 bonus to that skill. Each skill also has a stat associated with it. Your ability modifier for that stat is added to skill checks made with that skill. You probably only want to put skill points into Class Skills. A description of each skill can be found on the PRD.
Things to note:
=E=Humans get an additional skill point each level.
=E=Clerics receive an additional class skill depending on what Domains they choose.
=E=Oracles receive an additional class skill depending on what Mystery they choose.
=E=Sorcerers receive an additional class skill depending on what Bloodline they choose.

=1=Pick Feats
Most characters only need to choose one feat, but there are some exceptions. Also note if your character receives any feats for free at first level, such as Wizards receiving Scribe Scroll for free. There are very many feats. If you don't know what to choose, the PRD has a decent suggestion list here:

Things to note:
=E=Humans get a bonus feat at level 1.
=E=Fighters get a bonus Combat Feat at level 1.

=1=Pick Equipment
Each class begins the game with a different amount of gold. The amount for each class is found below. There are specific things you want to buy with this money. First, a weapon your character is proficient with. Second, armor if you aren't an Arcane spellcaster with some special ability that lets you wear armor. Third, basic adventuring gear. The easiest way to choose gear for your class is to buy the Kit listed for your class below. Additional adventuring gear can be found in the following section of the PRD.
=L=http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateEquipment/gear/adventuringGear.html: Adventuring Gear
If you have any left over money, buy other things you think you might want.
